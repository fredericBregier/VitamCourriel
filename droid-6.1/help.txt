     -q,--quiet                          [optional] When run in PROFILE mode
                                         DROID will limit its console output to
                                         errors only.  When run in NO PROFILE
                                         mode DROID will limit its output to
                                         CSV data only.
     -R,--recurse                        [optional] Recurse into all subfolders
                                         of any folder specified using the -a
                                         or -Nr options. Files in all
                                         sub-folders (and their sub-folders,
                                         and so on) will be processed as well.
                                         If this option is omitted, only the
                                         files directly under the folder will
                                         be processed. For example:
                                         droid -R -a "C:\Files\Another Folder"
                                         -p "C:\Results\result3.droid"
  -a,--profile-resources <resources>  Add resources to a new profile and run
                                      it.  Resources are the file path of any
                                      file or folder you want to profile.  The
                                      file paths should be given surrounded in
                                      double quotes, and separated by spaces
                                      from each other.  The profile results
                                      will be saved to a single file specified
                                      using the -p option.
                                      For example: droid -a "C:\Files\A Folder"
                                      "C:\Files\file.xxx" -p
                                      "C:\Results\result1.droid"
                                      Note: You cannot use reporting, filtering
                                      and exporting when using the -a option.
     -p,--profile(s) <filename(s)>       When used in conjunction with
                                         reporting, filtering or exporting, -p
                                         specifies a list of profiles to open.
                                         The file paths of the profiles should
                                         be bounded by double quotes, and
                                         separated by spaces from each other.
                                         When used in conjunction with the -a
                                         option, the results of the new profile
                                         will be saved to that file, and you
                                         can only specify a single file.
                                         For example: droid -p
                                         "C:\Results\result1.droid"
                                         "C:\Results\result2.droid" -e
                                         "C:\ExportscombinedResults.csv"
                                         droid -a "C:\Files\A Folder"
                                         "C:\Files\file.xxx" -p
                                         "C:\Results\result1.droid"
     -q,--quiet                          [optional] When run in PROFILE mode
                                         DROID will limit its console output to
                                         errors only.  When run in NO PROFILE
                                         mode DROID will limit its output to
                                         CSV data only.
     -R,--recurse                        [optional] Recurse into all subfolders
                                         of any folder specified using the -a
                                         or -Nr options. Files in all
                                         sub-folders (and their sub-folders,
                                         and so on) will be processed as well.
                                         If this option is omitted, only the
                                         files directly under the folder will
                                         be processed. For example:
                                         droid -R -a "C:\Files\Another Folder"
                                         -p "C:\Results\result3.droid"
  -e,--export-file <filename>         Export profiles to a CSV file with one
                                      row per profiled file.  If any filters
                                      are specified, then they will apply to
                                      the exported file.
                                      For example: droid -p
                                      "C:\Results\result1.droid"
                                      "C:\Results\result2.droid" -e
                                      "C:\ExportscombinedResults.csv"
                                      droid -p "C:\Results\result3.droid" -f
                                      "PUID any_of fmt/111 fmt/112" -e
                                      "C:\Exports\filteredResults.csv"
     -f,--filter-all <filter ...>        [optional] Filter the profiles
                                         specified using the -p option.  Only
                                         results which match ALL filter
                                         criteria specified will appear.
                                         Filter criteria are specified using
                                         the following method:
                                         <field><operator><values> where
                                         <field> is the name of a filterable
                                         field, <operator> is the type of
                                         comparison to use, and <values> are
                                         the value or values against which the
                                         field value should be compared.  The
                                         -k option provides information on the
                                         available fields and operators.  You
                                         can specify more than one filter
                                         criteria, bounded by double quotes and
                                         separated by spaces from each other.
                                         For example:
                                         droid -p "C:\Results\result3.droid"
                                         -f "PUID any_of fmt/111 fmt/112"
                                         -e "C:\Exports\filteredResults.csv"
                                         droid -p "C:\Results\result1.droid"
                                         "C:\Results\result2.droid"
                                         -f "file_size > 0"
                                         -e "C:\Exports\filteredResults.csv"
     -F,--filter-any <filter ...>        [optional] Filter profiles as the -f
                                         option does, except results which
                                         match ANY of the specified filter
                                         criteria will appear.
     -p,--profile(s) <filename(s)>       When used in conjunction with
                                         reporting, filtering or exporting, -p
                                         specifies a list of profiles to open.
                                         The file paths of the profiles should
                                         be bounded by double quotes, and
                                         separated by spaces from each other.
                                         When used in conjunction with the -a
                                         option, the results of the new profile
                                         will be saved to that file, and you
                                         can only specify a single file.
                                         For example: droid -p
                                         "C:\Results\result1.droid"
                                         "C:\Results\result2.droid" -e
                                         "C:\ExportscombinedResults.csv"
                                         droid -a "C:\Files\A Folder"
                                         "C:\Files\file.xxx" -p
                                         "C:\Results\result1.droid"
  -E,--export-format <filename>       Export profiles to a CSV file with one
                                      row per profiled file/format.  If any
                                      filters are specified, then they will
                                      apply to the exported file.
                                      For example: droid -p
                                      "C:\Results\result1.droid"
                                      "C:\Results\result2.droid" -E
                                      "C:\ExportscombinedResults.csv"
                                      droid -p "C:\Results\result3.droid" -f
                                      "PUID any_of fmt/111 fmt/112" -E
                                      "C:\Exports\filteredResults.csv"
     -f,--filter-all <filter ...>        [optional] Filter the profiles
                                         specified using the -p option.  Only
                                         results which match ALL filter
                                         criteria specified will appear.
                                         Filter criteria are specified using
                                         the following method:
                                         <field><operator><values> where
                                         <field> is the name of a filterable
                                         field, <operator> is the type of
                                         comparison to use, and <values> are
                                         the value or values against which the
                                         field value should be compared.  The
                                         -k option provides information on the
                                         available fields and operators.  You
                                         can specify more than one filter
                                         criteria, bounded by double quotes and
                                         separated by spaces from each other.
                                         For example:
                                         droid -p "C:\Results\result3.droid"
                                         -f "PUID any_of fmt/111 fmt/112"
                                         -e "C:\Exports\filteredResults.csv"
                                         droid -p "C:\Results\result1.droid"
                                         "C:\Results\result2.droid"
                                         -f "file_size > 0"
                                         -e "C:\Exports\filteredResults.csv"
     -F,--filter-any <filter ...>        [optional] Filter profiles as the -f
                                         option does, except results which
                                         match ANY of the specified filter
                                         criteria will appear.
     -p,--profile(s) <filename(s)>       When used in conjunction with
                                         reporting, filtering or exporting, -p
                                         specifies a list of profiles to open.
                                         The file paths of the profiles should
                                         be bounded by double quotes, and
                                         separated by spaces from each other.
                                         When used in conjunction with the -a
                                         option, the results of the new profile
                                         will be saved to that file, and you
                                         can only specify a single file.
                                         For example: droid -p
                                         "C:\Results\result1.droid"
                                         "C:\Results\result2.droid" -e
                                         "C:\ExportscombinedResults.csv"
                                         droid -a "C:\Files\A Folder"
                                         "C:\Files\file.xxx" -p
                                         "C:\Results\result1.droid"
  -r,--report <filename>              Save the report generated to the file
                                      specified.  For example:
                                      droid -p "C:\Results\result1.droid" -n
                                      "PLANETS" -r
                                      "C:\Reports\result1Report.xml"
     -n,--report-name <report name>      Run the report with the specified name
                                         on any profiles opened using the -p
                                         option.  For example:
                                         droid -p "C:Results\result1.droid" -n
                                         "PLANETS" -r
                                         "C:\Reports\result1Report.xml"
     -p,--profile(s) <filename(s)>       When used in conjunction with
                                         reporting, filtering or exporting, -p
                                         specifies a list of profiles to open.
                                         The file paths of the profiles should
                                         be bounded by double quotes, and
                                         separated by spaces from each other.
                                         When used in conjunction with the -a
                                         option, the results of the new profile
                                         will be saved to that file, and you
                                         can only specify a single file.
                                         For example: droid -p
                                         "C:\Results\result1.droid"
                                         "C:\Results\result2.droid" -e

                                         droid -a "C:\Files\A Folder"
                                         "C:\Files\file.xxx" -p
                                         "C:\Results\result1.droid"
     -t,--report-type <report type>      Set the output file format of a
                                         report.
